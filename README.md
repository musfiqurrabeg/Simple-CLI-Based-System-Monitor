## ü§î What Does It Do?

System Pulse Monitor is a lightweight Python script that elegantly tracks and records your computer's performance over time. It captures the two most critical metrics:

* üß† **CPU Usage (%)**: Know how hard your processor is working.
* üíæ **Memory Usage (%)**: Keep tabs on your RAM consumption.

All data is neatly logged into a clean `.csv` file, timestamped and ready for analysis. Wondering why your machine slowed down last Tuesday at 4:17 PM? Now you can find out!

---

## ‚ú® Why You Need This

* **Diagnose Performance Issues**: Pinpoint exactly when and why your system is lagging.
* **Resource Planning**: Analyze usage trends to decide if it's time for a hardware upgrade.
* **Application Impact Analysis**: See how a new application or process affects your system's resources.
* **Peace of Mind**: Sleep better at night knowing you have a detailed log of your system's health.
* **It Just Looks Cool**: Impress your friends with a live-updating terminal of your system's pulse!

## üåü Features

* ‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring**: See live CPU and Memory stats printed directly to your terminal.
* ‚úÖ **CSV Logging**: Automatically saves historical data to `system_performance_log.csv`.
* ‚úÖ **Lightweight & Efficient**: Uses the `psutil` library for minimal performance overhead.
* ‚úÖ **Easy to Use**: Get started with just two commands.
* ‚úÖ **Customizable**: Easily change the logging interval to suit your needs.
* ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform**: Runs anywhere Python and `psutil` are supported (Windows, macOS, Linux).

python system_monitor.py
```

You'll immediately see the monitor come to life!

```bash
--- System Performance Monitor ---
Logging CPU and memory usage every 5 seconds.
Data will be saved to 'system_performance_log.csv'.
Press Ctrl+C to stop the script.
Log file 'system_performance_log.csv' created with headers.
2023-10-27 10:30:05 - CPU: 12.5% | Memory: 45.8%
2023-10-27 10:30:10 - CPU: 25.1% | Memory: 46.2%
2023-10-27 10:30:15 - CPU: 18.9% | Memory: 46.1%
```

To stop the monitor, press Ctrl+C. Your log file will be waiting for you.

üìÑ Log File Output
The generated system_performance_log.csv file will look like this, perfect for importing into Excel, Google Sheets, or a data analysis script.


‚öôÔ∏è Customization
Want to log more or less frequently? It's easy!

Open sys_monitor.py and change the LOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS variable:

# --- Configuration ---
LOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 2  # Change this value (in seconds)
